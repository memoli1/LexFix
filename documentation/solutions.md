# Proposed Solutions for User Interface Design

## Context
The application is being developed for a company managing court documents with their own server. The goal is to process these documents securely, efficiently, 
and in a user-friendly manner.

Below are two possible solutions: a **local web app** and a **local desktop app**, with the recommendation leaning towards 
the web app due to its scalability and centralized management.

---

## Solution 1: Local Web App (Recommended)

A **self-hosted web application** deployed on the company’s server, accessible through browsers on the internal network.

### **Advantages**
1. **Security**:
    - Data never leaves the company’s private network.
    - Access can be restricted to authorized personnel via secure login systems.

2. **Flexibility**:
    - Accessible on multiple devices (PCs, tablets, etc.) without installations.
    - Easy to scale for multiple users simultaneously.

3. **Centralized Management**:
    - Updates and bug fixes apply only to the server.
    - IT teams can monitor and maintain centrally.

4. **Integration**:
    - Can be integrated with other internal systems (e.g., document storage, case management software).

---

### **Tech Stack**
- **Backend**: Flask/Django (Python)
- **Frontend**: React/Angular/Vue.js for a responsive UI
- **PDF Processing**: Libraries like `PyPDF2`, `fpdf`, and `SymSpell`
- **Database**:
    - SQLite (for lightweight needs)
    - PostgreSQL (for scalability)
- **Deployment**: Docker containers and Nginx for HTTPS connections

---

### **Workflow for Users**
1. **Log In**:
    - Secure authentication (e.g., username/password, 2FA).

2. **Upload File**:
    - Drag-and-drop or file selection for uploading court documents (PDFs).

3. **Process Document**:
    - App processes the PDF (corrects spelling, fixes margins, etc.).
    - Preview corrected document before finalizing.

4. **Download/Save**:
    - Save the corrected document back to the server or download it locally.

## Solution 2: Local Desktop App

A **standalone desktop application** installed on individual workstations.

### **Advantages**
1. **Offline Functionality**:
    - Operates without needing constant server access.

2. **Simpler Infrastructure**:
    - No need for server maintenance or deployment.

---

### **Tech Stack**
- **Frontend and Backend**:
    - Python with PyQt or Tkinter for GUI development.
    - Electron.js for a web-like interface.
- **PDF Processing**: Libraries like `PyPDF2`, `fpdf`, and `SymSpell`.

---

### **Workflow for Users**
1. **Install the App**:
    - Individual installations on each workstation.

2. **Upload File**:
    - Use file selection to upload PDFs.

3. **Process Document**:
    - The app processes the PDF and shows a preview.

4. **Save Document**:
    - Save the corrected document to a specified folder on the local machine.

### 7. Package the Application

Distribute the app as an executable file using tools like:

## Recommendation

### **Local Web App**
This solution is recommended due to:
- **Centralized management**: Easier updates and scalability.
- **Multi-user access**: Accessible via browser by multiple employees.
- **Security**: All data remains within the private network.
